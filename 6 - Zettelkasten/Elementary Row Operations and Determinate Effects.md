# Elementary Row Operations and Determinant Effects

Recall that there are three elementary row operations, which change the [[Determinant]] in predictable ways.
They are as follows (the specific numbering is not standard):
1) Multiplying by a non-zero constant.
2) Switching 2 rows
3) Replacing a row w/the sum of the row and a multiple of another row.
#### Effects on Determinant:
A type 1 row operation multiplies the determinant by the same constant.
A type 2 row operation changes the sign of the determinant.
A type 3 row operation does not change the determinant.
