# Fitting the Simple Linear Regression Model

##### A First-Order Linear Model
The first-order linear model is expressed as 
$y = \beta _{0} + \beta _{1} x + \epsilon$
where: 
- y is the dependent variable
- x is the independent variable
- The expected value, $E(y) = \beta _{0} + \beta _{1}x$$ is the deterministic component.
- $\epsilon$ is the random error component. 
- $\beta _{0}$ is the y-intercept of the line, i.e. where it crosses they axis.
- $\beta _{1}$ is the slope of the line, i.e. the derivative. 

$\beta _{1}$ and $\beta _{0}$ are population parameters. 

Note: Parameters are not r.v.s

##### Some R stuff
Tidyverse is mandatory for this course.
