# In-place Algorithm
An in place algorithm is an algorithm which does not need additional space in proportion to its input size. A good example is [[Insertion Sort]], which uses a finite amount of additional space instead of an amount that depends on the size you are sorting. Most sorting and selection algorithms operate in-place.
