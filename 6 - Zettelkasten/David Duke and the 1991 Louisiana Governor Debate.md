# David Duke and the 1991 Louisiana Governor Debate 


Thesis of video: David Duke's 1991 gubernatorial campaign set a template for modern right-wing populist rhetoric, influencing figures like Donald Trump.

Q: Why is the 1991 Louisiana Governor's Debate interesting in the career of David Duke?
A: Duke was on the verge of a surprise victory against his opponent, Edwin Edwards, a crooked Democrat politician running in the legacy of [[Huey Long]].

Q: How did a Nazi former KKK member get there to begin with?
A: Bigotry can be nuanced and twisted by expertly deflecting and presenting the right arguments. 

Background: Edwards unexpectedly had to face Duke instead of Republican incumbent Buddy Roemer. David Duke employed a soft-spoken approach to discussions, non-aggressively advocating for hearing every argument. Relies on audience support. Despite being a Grand Wizard of the KKK, Duke publicly turns his back on the Klan.
"White Civil Rights Movement" started by Duke in 1987 Forsyth protest.

The Debate:
Four panelists and a moderator. Duke and Edwards asked a number of questions about industry and their legislative agenda, where Duke fails to specify anything he advocates for, a single industry connection he has, any of the benefactors of Edwards' corruption, or any of the top 3 industries in LA. Duke claims running a Neo-Nazi parody of the NAACP (the NAAWP) as experience running a non-profit.
Black Panelist asks Duke: "As a minority who has heard you say some [...] diabolical things about every minority - I am scared. List given, e.g. horses contributed more to building America than blacks. Convince me [...] why we should entrust our lives [...] to you." Duke claims this is a cheap shot, unable to deflect a genuine question asked out of vulnerability. 

Aftermath: Increased national attention and funding for both candidates, Bush: "Duke is a racist and a charlatan." Edwards coins "Vote for the crook" slogan. Duke loses 61.7% - 38.8%. Duke receives 55% of white vote.
