# Algorithms

Informally, an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output. 
We want to use these for computational problems, transforming inputs into outputs. Common examples of algorithms are [[Sorting Algorithms]], or procedures such as [[Matrix Multiplication]]. More or less, an algorithm can also be used for any well specified computational problem such as the [[Sorting Problem]]. Naturally, as computing resources are not free, one should always be aware of the [[Algorithmic Efficiency]] of an algorithm.

It is important to note that there are numerous ways to define an algorithm. They can be defined in English, pictorally, or otherwise. Optimally, I should strive to construct them in pseudo code when possible.

Not all problems have established, published algorithms to solve. This is why [[Algorithm Design]] and [[Algorithm Analysis]] is important. There are numerous techniques, such as [[Divide and Conquer]] and [[Dynamic Programming]] or even [[Amortized Analysis]] for tackling problems without published algorithms. However, not all problems have a known solution or may even have a possible solution, such as the problem of [[NP Completeness]].
